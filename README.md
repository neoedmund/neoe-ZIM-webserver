ZIM Webserver By neoe
========================
This is a webserver to host ZIM files.
You can start it locally and view ZIM contents using any web browser.
You can use this instead of clients like Kiwix.


## How to use:
# download this repo.
# edit zims.conf (point zim names to your local zim files)
# run `runit.cmd` (you need JDK 8)
# open firefox(or any other browser) and visit http://127.0.0.1:8099/
# enjoy!
